# CSS grid lessons.

I will be Following the course lessons by Per Borgen at Scrimba. [CSS Grid Course](https://scrimba.com/g/gR8PTE)

## **Lesson-1: Your first grid**.

   * On this lesson I will be working on learning how to build my first grid using the **grid-template-columns** and **grid-template** properties. Also the **grid-gap** property had been covered on this lesson.

   * I've created a grid of 2 columns and 3 rows and give it a little space (gap) between the rows and columns.
